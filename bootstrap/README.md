# Bootstrap

The bootstrap folder exists to make the mono repository easier
to work with.

## Initialization

Calling bootstrap.ps1 will add `/bootstrap/scripts` to the path
variable so that PowerShell scripts can be invoked as commands
similar to executables and load any core PowerShell modules as needed.
